Load and Query DynamoDB Tables

Objective
The goal of this project was to explore how to use Amazon DynamoDB to create tables, load data, run queries, and manage transactions for efficient data handling.

Steps
1. Create DynamoDB Tables: Set up DynamoDB tables for storing data.
2. Load Data: Insert data into the created tables.
3. Run Queries: Query data from DynamoDB using partition and sort keys.
4. Transactions: Use transactions to update multiple tables simultaneously, ensuring data consistency.

Things Learned
- DynamoDB Basics: Learned how to set up tables and load data.
- Querying: Got hands-on experience querying data with partition and sort keys.
- Transactions: Understood how to use transactions to ensure consistency when updating multiple tables at once.

This project helped me gain a deeper understanding of DynamoDB and its features.
